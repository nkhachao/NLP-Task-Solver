# Trasformer-based Natural Language Task Solving App
This project was initially about developing a simple question-answering (QA) app based on a pre-trained Transformer encoder. During the development, we became so amazed by the flexibility of Transformer models that we decided to experiment more and created "Natural Language Task Solving App", an app that solves problems like NER, GEC, MCQA, ... using Transformer-based models.
